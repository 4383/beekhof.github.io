For a variety of reasons, the Pacemaker _dev_ repository has been recreated
and its history pruned of non-pacemaker related changes.

Any existing clones need to be removed and re-cloned as the all the changeset
hashes have changed and it is fundamentally a different repository.

The good news though, is that with the help of some Mercurial hacking, any
links using the "old" hashes will still work.
