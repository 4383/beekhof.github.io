With Posterous being shut down (even though I wasn't using it for TheClusterGuy), I've decided the time has come to take back control of my content.

As a result I've started using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for publishing.

It is pretty nifty. 
Octopress generates a static site (good for performance!) that can either be hosted at GitHub or (if GitHub ever goes dark) anywhere Apache can run. 
As you will notice, I was even able to easily import all my old posts!

For now I'm taking the GitHub path with a custom domain name (not the same as this one so that the old links still work).

I'm quite linking the theme/layout and feature set.
I'm even taking the opportunity to support comments for the first time... we'll see how long that lasts before the spammers make it no longer worth the time.
