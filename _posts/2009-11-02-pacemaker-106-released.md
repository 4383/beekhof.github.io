The next installment of the
[Pacemaker](http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Pacemaker) 1.0 stable series is
now ready for general consumption.

In addition to further polishing of the crm shell and CLI tools, this is the
first release to support CoroSync (version 1.1.2 or greater is required).

The "Pacemaker Explained" reference has also been converted to docbook and is
included as part of the tarball (and pre-built packages if the relevant
stylesheets are present at build time).

Pre-built packages for Pacemaker and it's immediate dependancies will be
available for openSUSE, SLES, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS from the [OpenSUSE Build
Service](http://software.opensuse.org/download/server:/ha-clustering) in the
next couple of days depending in how overloaded it is.

Debian users should check for updates 
[Martin's repo](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install#Debian) 
over the coming days and Ubuntu fans can visit
[LaunchPad](https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ha-maintainers/+archive/ppa) 
for 8.04 and 9.10 packages.

The [source tarball](http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/stable-1.0/archive/Pacemaker-1.0.6.tar.bz2) is also available directly from Mercurial.

General installation instructions are available at from the [ClusterLabs wiki](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install).
