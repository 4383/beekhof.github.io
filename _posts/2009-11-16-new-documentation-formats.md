I'm pleased to report that the core Pacemaker documentation is now available
in PDF, HTML (chunked and single page) and even TXT formats.

The old [Pages.app](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) sources have been
replaced with [DocBook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) which allows
them to be:

  * published in a variety of formats
  * kept under version control
  * included in the packages
  * updated by anybody

Additionally, we're using [Publican](https://fedorahosted.org/publican/) to
produce the final result so supporting multiple languages should be now
possible. Let us know if you're interested in doing some translation :-)

The primary location for Pacemaker documentation will remain [http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Documentation](http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Documentation)
however there is also a index of the generated documentation at
[http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/](http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/) which
includes the date and version from which it was generated.
