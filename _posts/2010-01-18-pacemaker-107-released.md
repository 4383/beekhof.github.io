tags:

The latest installment of the
[Pacemaker](http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Pacemaker) 1.0 stable series is
now ready for general consumption.

In this release, we've made a number improvements to clone handling -
particularly the way ordering constraints are processed - as well as some
really nice improvements to the shell.

The next 1.0 release is anticipated to be in mid-March. We will be switching
to a bi-monthly release schedule to begin focusing on development for the next
stable series (more details soon). If you have feature requests, now is the
time to voice them and/or provide patches :-)

Pre-built packages for Pacemaker and it's immediate dependancies are currently
building and will be available for openSUSE, SLES, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS from
the [ClusterLabs Build Area](http://www.clusterlabs.org/rpm/) shortly.

Debian users should check for updates [Martin's repo](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install#Debian) over the coming days and
Ubuntu fans can visit [LaunchPad](https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ha-maintainers/+archive/ppa) for 8.04 and 9.10 packages.

The [source tarball](http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/stable-1.0/archive/Pacemaker-1.0.7.tar.bz2) is also available directly from Mercurial.

General installation instructions are available at from the [ClusterLabs wiki](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install).
