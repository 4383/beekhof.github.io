Good news for Debian fans, Pacemaker has officially made it into
[Sid](http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/).

According to their [blog post](http://fghaas.wordpress.com/2010/04/07
/complete-pacemaker-cluster-stack-now-in-debian/), it should also be available
as an official [backport](http://backports.org) for existing Debian stable
releases "soon".
