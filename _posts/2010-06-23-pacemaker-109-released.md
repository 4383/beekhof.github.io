title: Pacemaker 1.0.9 Released
tags:

---
The latest installment of the
[Pacemaker](http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Pacemaker) 1.0 stable series is
now ready for general consumption.

Coinciding with 1.0.9 is a new version of Corosync (1.2.5). Included in both
are some important fixes that should resolve most of the startup issues people
have been seeing. Also included in this release are the fixes for issues
reported by [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) and
[Coverity](http://www.coverity.com/products/static-analysis.html).

As per our [release calendar](http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/ReleaseCalendar),
the next 1.0 release is planned for mid-September and 1.1.3 will be
available in late July.

> I'd like to particularly thank Keisuke MORI for his help with this release.
> Keisuke-san has taken on the role of Patch Manager for 1.0, so it is because
> of his hard work that we have backports of all the bugfixes from 1.1 :-)
>
> This change has enabled me to focus on 1.1 and, I hope, be slightly more
> responsive to bug reports and questions on the mailing list(s).

Pre-built packages for Pacemaker and it's immediate dependancies are available
immediately for openSUSE, SLES, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS from the [ClusterLabs Build Area](http://www.clusterlabs.org/rpm/).

Regular updaters may also have noticed the expanded version scheme used by
packages on clusterlabs.org. The build scripts now automatically bump the
version numbers when rebuilding the stack. This usually occurs when new
versions of corosync, cluster-glue or heartbeat come out.

Versions are now of the form: x.y.x-a.b

  * _x.y.z_ is the upstream version (this is the only time the tarball is changed)
  * _a_ indicates the number of spec file changes (ie. changes to dependancies)
  * _b_ indicates how many times the package has been rebuilt with unchanged tarballs and spec files

So the following version: pacemaker-1.0.9-1.4 would mean the fourth rebuild of
the initial spec file for the upstream version _1.0.9_ of Pacemaker.

Debian users should check for updates [Martin's repo](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install#Debian) over the coming days and
Ubuntu fans can visit [LaunchPad](https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ha-maintainers/+archive/ppa) for 8.04 and 9.10 packages.

The [source tarball](http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/stable-1.0/archive/Pacemaker-1.0.9.tar.bz2) is also available directly from Mercurial.

General installation instructions are available at from the [ClusterLabs wiki](http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install).
